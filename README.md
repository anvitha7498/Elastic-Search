# Deploying ELK Stack and Filebeats in Cloud and Local  

This repository contains the project report and implementation details for **Deploying the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) and Filebeats** in cloud and local environments. This project demonstrates how to configure and integrate the ELK stack to collect, process, and visualize system logs, along with additional configurations like X-Pack security and Zeek log analysis.

## Overview  
The ELK Stack is a powerful open-source solution for managing and analyzing logs. This project aims to implement ELK along with Filebeats for monitoring logs and improving security by integrating X-Pack. Zeek logs are also incorporated for enhanced insights into network traffic.  

## Features  
- **Elasticsearch**: A distributed search and analytics engine to store and query log data.  
- **Logstash**: Pipelines to collect, process, and enrich logs.  
- **Kibana**: Visualize data trends using interactive dashboards.  
- **Filebeats**: Lightweight log shipping agents for forwarding logs.  
- **X-Pack Security**: Provides authentication and secure access to the ELK Stack.  
- **Zeek Logs Integration**: Monitors network traffic and provides detailed logs.  

## Setup and Installation  
Follow these steps to set up the ELK stack:  

1. **Install Java**:  
   ```bash  
   sudo apt install default-jdk default-jre -y  
   ```  
2. **Add Elastic GPG Key**:  
   ```bash  
   curl -fsSL https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -  
   echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/7.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-7.x.list  
   sudo apt update  
   ```  
3. **Install Elasticsearch**:  
   ```bash  
   sudo apt install elasticsearch -y  
   nano /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml  # Configure Elasticsearch  
   ```  
4. **Install Logstash**:  
   ```bash  
   sudo apt install logstash -y  
   systemctl start logstash  
   ```  
5. **Install Kibana**:  
   ```bash  
   sudo apt install kibana -y  
   nano /etc/kibana/kibana.yml  # Configure Kibana  
   ```  
6. **Access Kibana Dashboard**: Open `http://localhost:5601` in your browser.  

For more detailed installation steps, refer to the **Project Report** in this repository.  

## Technologies Used  
- **ELK Stack**: Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana  
- **Filebeats**: Log forwarding and centralizing agent  
- **Zeek**: Network security monitoring logs  
- **X-Pack**: Security features for ELK

## Usage Instructions  
1. Start the Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana services:  
   ```bash  
   systemctl start elasticsearch logstash kibana  
   ```  
2. Access the Kibana dashboard at `http://localhost:5601`.  
3. Use generated passwords for accessing secure features via X-Pack.  
4. Configure Filebeats to forward logs for real-time analysis.
